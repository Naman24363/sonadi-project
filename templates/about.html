    <section class="about-section">
      <p>
        Founded in 2001 under the visionary leadership of Mrs. Bandana Sengupta
        and Dr. Vijay Kumar, Sonadi Charitable Trust began its journey from
        Chittaranjan Park, New Delhi, with a single mission — to bring
        compassionate care to the lives of voiceless animals.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a modest beginning, Sonadi has grown into a leading shelter and
        treatment facility for injured, abandoned, and mistreated street
        animals. With an unwavering commitment to animal welfare, our dedicated
        team of veterinarians, para-vets, caretakers, and volunteers has
        transformed thousands of lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sonadi is dedicated to improving the lives of animals through various
        activities. These include the Animal Birth Control Program, which
        effectively reduces conflicts between humans and animals, manages the
        population of street dogs, and eliminates rabies. The organization
        operates a specialized and well-equipped unit for sterilization
        surgeries on dogs and cats, providing post-surgery care and necessary
        medication for their recovery.
        <br /><br />
        Additionally, Sonadi conducts animal rescue operations with a medical
        ambulance facility, providing immediate attention to ill, injured, and
        abandoned animals. The organization also collaborates with various
        groups to run free doorstep anti-rabies vaccination drives for street
        dogs and cats. After receiving treatment and making a full recovery,
        community animals are returned to their original locations, and efforts
        are made to find new homes for abandoned dogs and cats. Sonadi also
        focuses on human education and awareness, encouraging people to take
        responsibility for area dogs, provide medical care, and develop love and
        compassion towards animals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, Sonadi has performed more than 60,000 Animal Birth
        Control surgeries, treated countless animals suffering from injuries and
        illnesses, and provided a loving sanctuary for those who can no longer
        survive on the streets. Every life that enters our shelter is treated
        with dignity, care, and a genuine commitment to healing.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Sonadi, we envision a future where no animal suffers alone. Our goal
        is to create a state-of-the-art, compassionate medical facility where
        abandoned and injured animals receive not only the treatment they need
        but also the love and respect they deserve.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together with our supporters and the broader community, we continue to
        advocate for responsible animal care, promote adoption, and spread
        awareness about the humane treatment of animals. Join us in making the
        world a kinder, more inclusive place — one paw at a time.
