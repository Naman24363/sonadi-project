          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2001 under the visionary leadership of Mrs. Bandana
            Sengupta and Dr. Vijay Kumar,
            <strong>Sonadi Charitable Trust</strong> began its journey in
            Chittaranjan Park, New Delhi, with a single mission — to bring
            compassionate care to the lives of voiceless animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            From modest beginnings, Sonadi has grown into a leading shelter and
            treatment facility for injured, abandoned, and mistreated street
            animals. With unwavering commitment, our veterinarians, para-vets,
            caretakers, and volunteers have transformed thousands of lives.

          <p>
            Sonadi has successfully performed over
            <strong>{{ about_stats.abc_surgeries_count }} ABC surgeries</strong
            >, treated countless injured animals, and provided lifelong shelter
            to many who can no longer survive on the streets.

          <p>
            Through adoption campaigns, awareness drives, and community
            outreach, we're building a culture of compassion — one paw at a
            time.
