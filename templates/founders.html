        <h3>Mrs. Bandana Sen Gupta</h3>
        <p class="founder-role">Founder & President, Sonadi Charitable Trust</p>
        <p class="founder-bio">
          Mrs. Bandana Sen Gupta is the visionary Founder and President of
          Sonadi Charitable Trust, an organization she established in 1999 to
          champion the welfare of stray and abandoned animals in Delhi. Driven
          by deep compassion, she left her teaching profession to dedicate
          herself entirely to animal welfare.
        </p>
        <p class="founder-bio">
          Under her leadership, the trust has provided shelter to hundreds of
          animals monthly, including dogs, cats, cows, and donkeys. Mrs. Sen
          Gupta has been instrumental in implementing Animal Birth Control (ABC)
          programs in collaboration with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and
          the Animal Welfare Board of India. Her unwavering commitment has
          significantly contributed to reducing rabies cases and controlling the
          stray animal population in the region.
        </p>
        <p class="founder-bio">
          Beyond her administrative role, she actively engages in daily
          operations, ensuring that each animal receives the care and attention
          it deserves. Her dedication extends to working closely with
          institutions like the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, where she has
          been involved for over 18 years, providing medical assistance to
          animals in need.
        </p>
        <p class="founder-bio">
          Mrs. Sen Gupta's tireless efforts and compassionate approach have not
          only transformed countless animal lives but have also inspired a
          community to embrace kindness and responsibility towards all living
          beings.
