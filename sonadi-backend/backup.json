    "message": "Sheru was a street dog who lived near our house for many years. He was friendly and always wagged his tail whenever he saw us, but he never had a proper place to stay. He slept on the footpath and sometimes went hungry for days. Once, he got hurt near his leg and started limping. We felt bad but did not know what to do.\r\nThen the team from Sonadi Charitable Trust came to our area. They cleaned his wound, gave him medicine, and told us that they would come again for his vaccination. They also explained how to care for street dogs and keep water bowls for them in summer.\r\nWithin a few weeks, Sheru looked better. His fur became shiny, and his limp went away. He now stays near our gate, and we all feed him. Even the children in the lane love playing with him. he guards our street and barks at strangers, but never hurts anyone.",

When Sonadi Charitable Trust visited for their animal care camp, they saw Rocky and gave him a proper check-up.\r\nThey vaccinated him, gave him a tag on his collar, and told us how to feed him and keep water for him. Later, they came again and sterilised him safely so that he could live a better life. He stayed under care for a few days, then returned to the same lane.\r\nNow Rocky looks strong and healthy. He waits for kids to come from school, plays with them, and sits near the shops. People in the market call him by name. Seeing him smile makes everyone happy.\r\nWe realised how a little help from Sonadi changed not just one dogÆs life but also our thinking. We all feel responsible now for the animals who live near us.",

One morning, while playing in the garden, she suddenly slipped and hurt her leg badly. She could not stand and was crying in pain. We were terrified and did not know what to do.\r\nWe called Sonadi Charitable Trust for help. Their team arrived quickly with a doctor and a first aid kit. They treated Candice carefully and took her for an X-ray. It was a minor fracture, and they promised to help till she recovered fully. They visited us often to change the bandage and make sure she was healing well.\r\nWith their care and guidance, Candice recovered completely. She started walking again and slowly returned to her cheerful self. Seeing her wag her tail again after so many days made us all emotional.\r\nWe are very thankful to Sonadi for their quick help and kindness.

We were worried and called Sonadi Charitable Trust for guidance.\r\nTheir team immediately arranged a doctor visit. Ash was treated, given stitches, and put on antibiotics. Sonadi also checked up on him every few days, asking if he was eating properly and whether his bandage was fine. They even guided us on how to make a small soft boot for him so that he could walk comfortably during healing.\r\nWithin a few weeks, Ash was back to running around the house, full of energy and joy.
